# ArduinoExtra

## Setup

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). The 2.0.0 version of the IDE just came out, but we haven't had a chance to test it out yet. If something doesn't work, try installing the legacy version instead.
2. Install CrcLib, ArduinoExtra and ArxSmartPtr (see programming resouces document)
3. Clone this repository in the User/Documents/Arduino/libraries/ folder (or equivalent on Mac).
4. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new project. Write `#include <RobotUtils.h>` at the top of the file and press verify to make sure everything is installed properly.
5. Open the cloned repository in VSCode or another text editor/IDE (make sure you don't commit your project files on accident).

**NOTE**: Write all the library code in this folder, but any tests should be done within the Arduino IDE.
