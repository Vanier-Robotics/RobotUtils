# ArduinoExtra

## Setup

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Use the new 2.0.0 version if possible as it is easier to work with.
2. Install CrcLib, ArduinoExtra and ArxSmartPtr (see programming resources document)
3. Clone this repository in the User/Documents/Arduino/libraries/ folder (or equivalent on Mac).
4. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new project. Select the `Arduino Mega or Mega 2560` board. Write `#include <RobotUtils.h>` at the top of the file and press verify to make sure everything is installed properly.
5. Open the cloned repository in VSCode or another text editor/IDE (make sure you don't commit your project files on accident).

**NOTE**: Write all the library code in this folder, but any tests should be done within the Arduino IDE.
